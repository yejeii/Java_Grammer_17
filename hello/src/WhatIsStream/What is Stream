Collection : To represent group of data/objects as single entity.

java.util.Stream
- To process the data from collection.
- To process the data from collection, Streams use 2 mechanism.
    1. Filter
    2. Map
   
참고>
Different with java.io.Stream..
    -> Use for the file.
java.util.Stream
    -> Use for collection.

1. Filter
  : Base on the condition, 
    filter some data and put them into another collection, or use for some other purpose.
2. Map
  : Get each object(element) from collection, 
    and apply some operation and put them into another collection, or use for some other purpose. 
Point is that the original Collection do not modified.
    
    
- Stream is kind of API
  Getting the collection's data into the stream, and process it using filter or map or other operation which Stream supports.
  And after processing, we can store data in some other collection.
  
- Stream's operation create by Lambda expression.
  Wanna implement the Stream to process the data from collection, we use Lambda expression.
